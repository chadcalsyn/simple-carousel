# simple-carousel

This small project shows a quick and dirty way of creating an image carousel or slider
on a webpage. The files needed to create the carousel are just carousel.css and carousel.js
along with any images and thumbnails you wish to display.

A version of this carousel is currently in place on my website at calsyn.x10host.com
